# Streaming at Scale- Mlops

This project allows users to interact with a machine learning model through a web interface. It consists of a frontend built with React.js and a backend web service implemented with Flask, deployed on AWS EC2 using Docker containers. The machine learning model provides predictions based on user input.

# Features
User-friendly Interface: The frontend provides a simple and intuitive user interface for interacting with the machine learning model.

- Backend Web Service: The backend is built with Flask and is responsible for handling user requests, processing data, and returning predictions from the machine learning model.

- Integration with Machine Learning Model: The backend integrates with a machine learning model to provide predictions based on user input.

- Form Submission: Users can submit entries through a form on the frontend, and the backend returns predictions based on the input data.
